Fooling around with some MLB data / API's

## plot_hits.py 
asks the user to input a player name, and will plot all their hits at their home ballpark for the season to date (2021)

## hit_predictor_log_reg.ipynb 
fooling around with a logistic regression model to predict if a batted ball will be a hit or not, based on launch speed, launch angle, and location

## on_2b.ipynb 
looking for who the most valuable player to have on 2nd base is. Intended to look for players that benefit their team while being on 2B (either by having speed, or by relaying signs to the batter) Can also be biased by players after them likely to drive them in though. But interesting that 3 out of top 4 are catchers
